.SS "void MoveTrayCommand::finish ()\fC [virtual]\fP"
Abstract function that runs after the while loop and only once\&. Normally wraps up a command and gets the robot ready to transition to a new command\&. 
.PP
Implements \fBCommand\fP\&.
.SS "bool MoveTrayCommand::isFinished ()\fC [virtual]\fP"
Abstract function that runs in a while loop and continously checks if the command should end\&. If true, ends while loop\&. Common use case is to check if timeout for command is exceeded 
.PP
\fBReturns\fP
.RS 4
True if command should end, false if it should not\&. 
.RE

.PP
Implements \fBCommand\fP\&.
.SS "void MoveTrayCommand::start ()\fC [virtual]\fP"
Abstract function that is called before the while loop only once\&. Common use case is to setup the command\&. 
.PP
Implements \fBCommand\fP\&.
.SS "void MoveTrayCommand::update ()\fC [virtual]\fP"
Abstract function that is run in a while loop until \fI\fBisFinished()\fP\fP returns true and contains the meat of the command, such as running motors\&. 
.PP
Implements \fBCommand\fP\&.
